= Zero-Conf Networking
Harishbabu Rengaraj

== Zero-Configuration 

* The primary concept is to eliminate DHCP, DNS and other
manual network settings on a small LAN.

* It let the hosts share the service with network and vice versa.

* Based on **mDNS**(Multicast Domain Name System) and **DNS-SD**(DNS Service Discovery).

== Automate

* Assignment of IP Address.

* Resolution by Hostname.

* Configuration of Network services such as Printers.

== Implementaion
Different OS have their own zero-conf implementation.

* **Apple** : `Bonjour`
  - Implemented on both Mac and iOS.

* **Linux/BSD** : `Avahi`
  - Emulates Apple Bonjour
  - Almost available in all distro by default.

* **Windows** : `Link-local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)`
