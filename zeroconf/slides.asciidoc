= Zero-Conf Networking
Harishbabu Rengaraj

== Zero-Configuration 

* The primary concept is to eliminate DHCP, DNS and other
manual network settings, Even the IP address in the PAN(Personal Area Network).

* It let the hosts share the service with network and vice versa.

* Based on **mDNS** (Multicast Domain Name System) and **DNS-SD**(DNS Service Discovery).


== Why mDNS?

* Resolution by Hostname.

* Configuration of Network services such as Printers.

* Share service across LAN.

* Able to communicate with APIPA addr `169.254.0.0/16`


== what is Multicast?

* falls under `class D` on IPv4.

* IP address not assigned to group of nodes.
  
* Which runs on port 5353/UDP. 

* According to IANA std,
  - IPv4: `224.0.0.254`
  - IPV6: `ff00::/8`
  
* Domain name `.local`

== Implementaion

Different OS have their own zero-conf implementation.

* **Apple** : `Bonjour`
  - Implemented on both Mac and iOS.

* **Linux/BSD** : `Avahi/FlexMDNS`
  - Came to linux on 2005.
  - Emulates Apple Bonjour.
  - Now, Almost available in all distro by default.

* **Windows** : `NetBIOS`
  - Resolve IP by just hostname.
  - Share resources between them.


== How it works?

* If a PC wants to access a website hosted by server(user-latitude-7400)
  the client request will be `http://user-latitude-7400.local/`
  
  - Client request to mDNS group 224.0.0.254 :

    	   - `Where are you? user-latitude-7400.local`.

  - Server responds to client :
  
    	   -`I'm here. 10.0.0.2`.

  - Then, the IP mapped to hostname and mDNS cache stored in client.

  - Next time, the client use its own cache file to identify the server.


== Android mDNS

* Android kind of support mDNS.

* Limited to apps that implemented specific API.

* It won't work like linux/Windows mDNS feature.
