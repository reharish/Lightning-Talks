== Bodging

* Usually a temporary repair; a patch, a repair.

* But, Works all the time.

== ** **

* In 2020, I got my first laptop with windows.

* Messed up windows. By Removing Partitions that i think not needed.

* Ended up having a Laptop with only BIOS.

* At that time all i know, Gnu/Linux is an OS.

== Red Pill or Blue Pill

* My curiosity chooses `red`.


== After Installation

Laptop have a Wifi/Bluetooth Combo plugged into one PCIe 1X slot (Qualcomm QCA9377).

* Debian can't detect the device as WiFi.

* But, Bluetooth works just fine.


== Initial Troubleshot

* Thought it was a driver issue, like in Windows.

* Got into the Qualcomm site. They have source code instead of `EXE` or other exec.

* Gone through all forums.

* No Luck.

== Troubleshot contd.

* WiFi not working in ubuntu 20.04

* QC9377 driver for ubuntu 20.04

* how to install from a source code

* what is build-essentials

* install gcc version 6

* set gcc6 as default

* how to build linux wifi driver

* modprobe drivers

* Do I need to reboot after modprobe?

* lsmod command

* blacklist.conf

* what is dmesg

* backport-Package

* build linux kernel from git source.


`Nothing Works`

== Troubleshot on Other Side.

* Tested with USB WiFi Dongle .. Works.

* Tried other distros such as Manjaro, Mint, Kali, Parrot, pop-OS, Boss, and others.

* Finally Contacted Support, They told me BIOS is specially made for Windows, So Please switch to it.

* Got a spark.

== Tweak in BIOS

* Went through all settings in BIOS.

* Nothing about that adapter. Other than PXE boot.

* The device must not be initialized.

* So, I put PXE WLAN BOOT on boot priority 1 and Linux on 2.

== Moment of Truth

* Switched Laptop ON.

* Booted into PXE WLAN boot. Failed to no source..Expected.

* Then, Got into ubuntu

* And, It works.

== ** **

* Its not the Authentic Solution for the issue but it works.

* I Bodged It.

== Authentic Solution

* Go to BIOS/UEFI

* Boot behaviour

* Change from Fast boot to Thorough. Will initialize all the Hardwares.



== Thank you
