== Network Mapper

=== Left

image::figures/nmap.jpg[align="center",width="100%"]

=== Right

    * Free & OpenSource utility.

    * Used for network discovery and security auditing.

    * Uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine OS, Service, and Inventory in the Network.

== Scan Types

   * TCP Connect Scans (-sT)

   * SYN "Half-open" Scans (-sS)

   * UDP Scans (-sU)

== TCP Connect Scan

=== Left

   * Nmap's Default scan.
   * Involves 3 way Handshake.
   * Achieved through -sT flag as arg.

E.g. `nmap -sT 10.10.10.1 -v`

=== Right

* A standard TCP Three-way Handshake


== Stealth Scan

   * Aka "Half-Open" scan.
   * Ends with RST Packet.
   * Its Like "Asking for something, then says Nevermind".

`nmap -sS <IP 4ddress>`

== UDP scan

   * Used to scan UDP ports. Its Stateless.
   * Sending Packets directly to the target ports.
   * If RST is reply. Then the port is closed.
   * Or Else the port marked as `Open|filtered`.


== Ping Sweep

   * Nmap sends an ICMP packet to each possible IP address for the specified network .
   * To obtain a "map" of the network-structure.
   * Achieved through `-sn` flag.
   
Eg.
	
`nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24`


== Advanced Scans

=== Right

* **Null Scan** (-sN) - No flag.
* **Fin Scan** (-sF) - Fin Flag only.
* **Xmas Scan** (-sX) - 3 flags.

As per RPC protocol the target should repond with RST, If port is closed.

Otherwise, the port considered as open.
