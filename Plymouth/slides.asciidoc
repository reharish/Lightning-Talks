= Boot Animation on Linux
Harishbabu Rengaraj

== Plymouth Service

  * Plymouth is an free bootsplash  application that runs very early in the boot process (even before the root filesystem is mounted!)
  * Linux supporting animations using Direct Rendering Manager (DRM). It gets packed into the initrd.
  * Besides eye-candy, Plymouth also handles user interaction during boot.
